# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive frontend management system that provides full administrative and user interfaces for all API features of the multi-tenant entity management platform. The system needs to support entity owners, tenant administrators, and system administrators with different levels of access and functionality. The frontend will provide intuitive interfaces for managing entities, attributes, notifications, interactions, tenants, and system analytics while maintaining the existing neumorphic design language.
