# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a GET method to the existing `/api/interaction_logs` endpoint to allow authenticated users to retrieve and filter interaction logs. Currently, the endpoint only supports POST for manually logging interactions. The new GET functionality will enable querying logs using the same attributes used for creating logs: eventType, entityId, and custom event payload data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to retrieve interaction logs, so that I can view historical interaction data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs as an authenticated user THEN the system SHALL return interaction logs I have access to
2. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs without authentication THEN the system SHALL require authentication
3. WHEN I am authenticated THEN the system SHALL show logs based on my permissions and ownership
4. WHEN no logs exist for my criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with appropriate metadata

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter interaction logs by event type, so that I can see specific types of interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs?eventType=entity_viewed THEN the system SHALL return only logs with that event type
2. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs without eventType parameter THEN the system SHALL return all logs (subject to other filters)
3. WHEN I provide multiple eventType values THEN the system SHALL support comma-separated values
4. WHEN I provide an invalid eventType THEN the system SHALL still process the request (may return empty results)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter interaction logs by entity ID, so that I can see all interactions related to a specific entity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs?entityId=123 THEN the system SHALL return only logs related to that entity
2. WHEN I combine entityId with eventType THEN both filters SHALL be applied using AND logic
3. WHEN I provide a non-existent entityId THEN the system SHALL return empty results
4. WHEN entityId parameter is provided THEN it SHALL filter by the entity_id field in the logs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter interaction logs by custom event payload attributes, so that I can find logs with specific data values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide custom query parameters THEN the system SHALL search within the event_payload JSON field
2. WHEN I combine custom filters with system filters THEN all filters SHALL work together using AND logic
3. WHEN custom attributes don't exist in logs THEN those logs SHALL be excluded from results
4. WHEN I provide nested attribute paths THEN the system SHALL support JSON path filtering where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want paginated results when retrieving interaction logs, so that I can efficiently browse through large volumes of log data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use page and limit parameters THEN the system SHALL return paginated results
2. WHEN no pagination is specified THEN the system SHALL use default values (page=1, limit=50)
3. WHEN I request logs THEN they SHALL be ordered by timestamp in descending order (newest first)
4. WHEN pagination is applied THEN the response SHALL include pagination metadata (page, limit, total, has_more)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter logs by date range, so that I can see interactions from specific time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide start_date parameter THEN the system SHALL return logs from that date onwards
2. WHEN I provide end_date parameter THEN the system SHALL return logs up to that date
3. WHEN I provide both start_date and end_date THEN the system SHALL return logs within that range
4. WHEN date parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
