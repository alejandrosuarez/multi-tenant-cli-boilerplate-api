# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a GET endpoint to the existing `/api/interaction_logs` route to allow querying and filtering of interaction logs. Currently, the endpoint only supports POST for manually logging interactions. The new GET functionality will enable retrieving logs based on various filters like event type, entity ID, and custom attributes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or admin, I want to query interaction logs by event type, so that I can analyze specific types of user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs with eventType parameter THEN the system SHALL return only logs matching that event type
2. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs without eventType parameter THEN the system SHALL return all logs (subject to other filters)
3. WHEN I provide an invalid eventType THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN I provide eventType parameter THEN the system SHALL apply it as a filter condition

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query interaction logs by entity ID, so that I can see all interactions related to a specific entity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request GET /api/interaction_logs with entityId parameter THEN the system SHALL return only logs related to that entity
2. WHEN I combine entityId with other filters THEN all filters SHALL be applied together using AND logic
3. WHEN I provide a non-existent entityId THEN the system SHALL return empty results
4. WHEN entityId parameter is provided THEN it SHALL filter by the entity_id field in the logs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to query interaction logs with pagination and sorting, so that I can efficiently browse through large volumes of log data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use pagination parameters (page, limit) THEN the system SHALL return paginated results correctly
2. WHEN I use sorting parameters THEN the system SHALL apply sorting to the filtered results
3. WHEN no pagination is specified THEN the system SHALL use default pagination (page=1, limit=50)
4. WHEN I request logs THEN they SHALL be ordered by timestamp in descending order by default

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query interaction logs by custom attributes in the event payload, so that I can filter logs based on specific data values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide custom attribute filters THEN the system SHALL search within the event_payload JSON field
2. WHEN I combine custom attribute filters with system filters THEN all filters SHALL work together
3. WHEN I provide nested attribute paths THEN the system SHALL support JSON path filtering
4. WHEN custom attributes don't exist THEN the system SHALL return empty results appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interaction logs endpoint to respect authentication and authorization, so that I can only see logs I'm authorized to view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am not authenticated THEN the system SHALL require authentication for the GET endpoint
2. WHEN I am authenticated THEN the system SHALL show logs based on my permissions
3. WHEN I am the entity owner THEN I SHALL see logs related to my entities
4. WHEN I have admin privileges THEN I SHALL see all logs (if applicable)
