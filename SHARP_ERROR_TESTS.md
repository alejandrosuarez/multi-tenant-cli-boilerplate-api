# Sharp Error Handling Tests

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive tests created to verify proper handling of Sharp image processing errors in the ImageService.

## Test Coverage

### 1. **Supabase Upload Verification When Sharp Fails**
- **Test**: `should call Supabase upload even when Sharp fails`
- **Purpose**: Ensures that even when Sharp throws errors during image resizing, Supabase upload operations are still executed
- **Key Assertions**:
  - Supabase upload method is called multiple times (5 times: 1 original + 4 optimized sizes)
  - Upload operation succeeds despite Sharp failures
  - All expected image sizes are present in the result

### 2. **Fallback URL Structure Verification**
- **Test**: `file_urls should contain valid URLs marked with fallback:true when Sharp fails`
- **Purpose**: Validates that `file_urls` contains properly structured URLs with correct fallback flags
- **Key Assertions**:
  - Original image has `is_fallback: false`
  - Size-specific images have `is_fallback: true` when Sharp fails
  - All URLs are valid HTTP/HTTPS format
  - All required properties (url, path, size, is_fallback) are present

### 3. **Multiple Upload Call Verification**
- **Test**: `should verify Supabase upload is called multiple times when Sharp fails`
- **Purpose**: Confirms that the upload process continues for all image sizes even with Sharp errors
- **Key Assertions**:
  - Exactly 5 upload calls are made (original + 4 sizes)
  - All expected image sizes are generated
  - Success response is returned despite Sharp failures

### 4. **URL Data Structure Validation**
- **Test**: `should ensure fallback URLs are properly structured`
- **Purpose**: Ensures all URL data objects have the correct structure and data types
- **Key Assertions**:
  - Each URL object has required properties
  - URLs follow valid HTTP/HTTPS format
  - Data types are correct (boolean for is_fallback, number for size)

### 5. **API Integration Simulation**
- **Test**: `getEntityImages should return non-empty URLs for API endpoint`
- **Purpose**: Simulates the behavior of the `/api/entities/:id/images` endpoint
- **Key Assertions**:
  - Returns successful response with image data
  - Each image has valid file_urls
  - Original URLs are not marked as fallback
  - Other sizes are marked as fallback when appropriate

### 6. **Image URL Helper Function Test**
- **Test**: `getImageUrl should return valid URLs for different sizes`
- **Purpose**: Tests the utility function that extracts URLs for specific image sizes
- **Key Assertions**:
  - Returns correct URLs for requested sizes
  - Falls back to original when requested size is unavailable

## Mock Strategy

### Sharp Mocking
```javascript
sharp.mockImplementation(() => ({
  resize: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
    throw new Error('Simulated Sharp error');
  }),
  jpeg: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  toBuffer: jest.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('Simulated Sharp error'))
}));
```

### Supabase Mocking
- Storage operations mocked to return successful responses
- Database operations mocked to simulate proper data insertion and retrieval
- Public URL generation mocked to return valid URLs

## Test Results
All tests pass successfully, confirming that:

1. ✅ **Supabase upload is still invoked** when Sharp fails
2. ✅ **file_urls contains valid URLs** with proper fallback flags
3. ✅ **API endpoint behavior** is simulated and returns non-empty URLs
4. ✅ **Error handling is robust** and maintains service functionality

## Console Output Verification
The test output shows the expected error handling behavior:
- Sharp errors are logged with `[Sharp-Fail]` messages
- Fallback behavior is triggered with `[Optimize-Fallback]` messages
- Upload operations succeed with `[Upload-Success]` messages
- Database operations complete with `[DB-Success]` messages

## Conclusion
These tests comprehensively verify that the ImageService maintains full functionality even when Sharp image processing fails, ensuring that:
- Images are still uploaded to Supabase storage
- Valid URLs are generated and marked appropriately as fallbacks
- The API continues to serve non-empty image URLs
- The system gracefully degrades when image optimization is unavailable
